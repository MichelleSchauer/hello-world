# hello-world
My first repository.
This is Michelle.  I've been creating end-to-end solutions in Microsoft Access for over 22 years.  I am passionate about creating customized applications for my users.  I've squeezed the guts out of MS Access!  Now I'm "branching" out and focusing more on the front-end developer role, learning javascript, css and html.  I'm eager to get started!  :)
